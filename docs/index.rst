Introduction
------------
This library provides a pure Python interface for the `Mention API <https://dev.mention.com/>`_. It only works with Python 3.

`Twitter <http://twitter.com>`_ provides a service that allows people to connect via the web, IM, and SMS. Twitter exposes a `web services API <http://dev.twitter.com/doc>`_ and this library is intended to make it even easier for Python programmers to use.
--------
What can this API do for you?

Mention is designed as a REST API with multiple clients: web (the web app, used on computers), iOS, and Android. A client is a program that will consume our API, that will use its endpoints and returned data.

You can do pretty much anything our web client can.

This will be most useful to:

    Integrate Mention capabilities into your own website, with your own layout and your own way of managing rights
    Use Mention as an intelligent crawler and use its output in your own systems / workflow
