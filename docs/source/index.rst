Introduction
------------
This library provides a pure Python interface for the `Mention API <https://dev.mention.com/>`_. It only works with Python 3.

`Mention <http://mention.com>` Mention is designed as a REST API with multiple clients: web (the web app, used on computers), iOS, and Android. A client is a program that will consume our API, that will use its endpoints and returned data.
--------
What can this API do for you?

Integrate Mention capabilities into your own website, with your own layout and your own way of managing rights
Use Mention as an intelligent crawler and use its output in your own systems / workflow

You can do pretty much anything our web client can.
