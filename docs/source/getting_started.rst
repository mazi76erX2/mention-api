Getting Started
===============

First, make sure you have:

- **Mention-Python** installed
- your Access token

See the :doc:`installation` page for help if needed.


App
==========

Assume your access token is stored in ``access_token`` for all API calls:

App Data
-----------------
Retrieves useful details about the application.

    Like some other resources, certain properties are translated given the Accept-Language header.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mention import AppDataAPI
    >>> appData = AppDataAPI(access_token)


Alert
==========

Create an Alert
--------------

You can create a new alert for a given ``account_id``.

The minimum requirements for a new alert are the parameters ``name`` as a string, ``queryd`` as a dictionary and ``languages`` as a list of strings.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> name = "Nandos"
    >>> queryd = {"type": "basic", "included_keywords": ["Nandos", "Flame-grilled Chicken", "Peri-Peri Sauce"]}
    >>> languages = ["en"]

    >>> newAlert = mention.CreateAnAlertAPI(access_token,
    							 			account_id,
    							 			name,
    							 			queryd,
    							 			languages)

    >>> data = newAlert.query()				

If the request was successful, the response will return the full alert data, like if you did a :ref:`Fetch An Alert <Fetch an Alert>`.		 			

Please view the `Create an alert <https://dev.mention.com/current/src/account/alert/PostAlert.html>`_ page to see all the available parameters and :class:`~mention.CreateAnAlertAPI` for formatting.


Fetch an Alert
--------------

Retrieve details about a single ``alert_id`` for a given ``account_id``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nandosAlert = mention.FetchAnAlertAPI(access_token,
    							 			  account_id,
    							 			  alert_id)

    >>> data = nandosAlert.query()

    >>> data['alert']['name']					 			
    >>> 'Nandos'

    >>> data['alert']['query']['included_keywords']					 			
    >>> ['Nandos', 'Flame-grilled Chicken', 'Peri-Peri Sauce']


Fetch all alerts of an account
------------------------------

Fetch a list of all alerts for a given ``account_id``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> allAlerts = mention.FetchAlertsAPI(access_token,
    							 		   account_id)

    >>> data = nandosAlert.query()

    >>> alertsList = data['alerts']	
    >>> alertsList[5]['alert']['name']
    >>> 'Nandos'			 			

    >>> data['alert']['query']['included_keywords']
    >>> ['Nandos', 'Flame-grilled Chicken', 'Peri-Peri Sauce']


Update an Alert
--------------

Modifies an existing alert, usually to update the criteria and to improve the search's efficiency for a given ``account_id``.

This API call has all of the same parameters as :ref:`Create An Alert <Create an Alert>`.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> name = "Nandos"
    >>> queryd = {"type": "basic", "included_keywords": ["Nandos", "Flame-grilled Chicken", "Peri-Peri Sauce", "Garlic Rolls"]}
    >>> languages = ["en", "af"]
    >>> countries = ["US", "ZA", "UK"]
    >>> sources = ["web", "twitter"]

    >>> updateNandosAlert = mention.UpdateAnAlertAPI(access_token,
    ...							 					 account_id,
    ...							 					 name,
    ...							 					 queryd,
    ...							 					 languages,
    ...							 					 countries,
    ...							 					 sources)

    >>> data = updateNandosAlert.query()				

Again a successful request will return the full alert data as a response.

Please view the `Update an alert <https://dev.mention.com/current/src/account/alert/PutAlert.html>`_ page to see all the available parameters and :class:`~mention.UpdateAnAlertAPI` for formatting.


Mention
==========

Fetch a mention
--------------

Retrieve details about a single ``mention_id`` for a given ``alert_id`` from an ``account_id``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nandosMention = mention.FetchAMentionAPI(access_token,
    							 			  	 account_id,
    							 			  	 alert_id,
    							 			  	 mention_id)

    >>> data = nandosMention.query()

    >>> data['title']					 			
    >>> 'Nando's launches their own food ordering app'

    >>> data['description']				 			
    >>> 'Nando's has launched their own app that will allow people to order their favourite meal from the comfort of their own home.'

    >>> data['original_url']				 			
    >>> 'https:\/\/www.iol.co.za\/business-report\/technology\/nandos-launches-their-own-food-ordering-app-18378360'


Fetch mentions
--------------

Fetch a list of all mention for a given ``alert_id`` from an ``account_id``.

There are 16 parameters which can be used to filter the mentions you receive as a response. Please note that some parameters cannot be used in combination with others. For example ``since_id`` cannot be combined with ``before_date``, ``not_before_date`` or ``cursor``. 

Please view the `Fetch Mentions<https://dev.mention.com/current/src/account/alert/mention/GetMentions.html>`_ page to see all the available parameters and :class:`~mention.FetchAllMentionsAPI` for formatting. For example read and favourite uses the python boolean type instead of a string.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

	>>> limit = '1000'
	>>> from = '2018-10-04 12:00'
	>>> to = '2018-11-25 12:00'
	>>> source = 'twitter'
	>>> read = True

    >>> nandosMentions = mention.FetchAllMentionsAPI(access_token,
                 									 account_id,
                 									 alert_id,
                 									 limit=limit,
                 									 before_date=to
                 									 not_before_date=from
                 									 source=source,
                 									 read=read)

    >>> data = nandosMentions.query()

    >>> firstMention = data['mentions'][0]

    >>> firstMention['title']					 			
    >>> 'Nando's launches their own food ordering app'

    >>> firstMention['description']				 			
    >>> 'Nando's has launched their own app that will allow people to order their favourite meal from the comfort of their own home.'

    >>> firstMention['original_url']				 			
    >>> 'https:\/\/www.iol.co.za\/business-report\/technology\/nandos-launches-their-own-food-ordering-app-18378360'

    >>> if len(data['_links']['more']['href']) == 0:
    >>> 	print('No more mentions to receive.')

    >>> 'No more mentions to receive.'

.. note::

    ``limit`` is capped at 1000. To view more mentions use the ``_links``, ``more`` and ``pull`` urls to receive all of your mentions. To learn more about this, read the bottom of `Fetch Mentions<https://dev.mention.com/current/src/account/alert/mention/GetMentions.html>`_.


Stream mention
--------------

Enables you to stream mentions for one or many alerts. It will open an http connection and keep it open, sending to your stream client any mention as soon as it is fetched for any of the selected alerts.

Requires a at least one ``alert_id`` from an ``account_id``.

Can pass the parameter ``since_id``.


Example:

.. code-block:: python


	>>> alerts = ['alert_id', '111222']
	>>> since_ids = ['', '43']
	
    >>> streamedMentions = mention.StreamMentionsAPI(access_token,
    												 alerts,
    												 since_ids)

    >>> data = streamedMentions.query()

    >>> firstStremedMentions = data['mentions'][0]


Curate a mention
--------------

Updates an existing ``mention_id`` for a given ``alert_id`` from an ``account_id``. These update concern majorly classification of the mention: indicating the folder, tags, effective tone of the mention, etc... You cannot modify the content of a mention, or its source.

There are 6 parameters which can be used to change how a mention is classified. ``favorite`` and ``trashed`` can only be editted by an admin. Please view the `Curate Mention<https://dev.mention.com/current/src/account/alert/mention/PutMention.html>`_ page to see all the available parameters and :class:`~mention.CurateAMentionAPI` for formatting.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

	>>> favorite = True
	>>> tone = '-1'

    >>> nandosMention = mention.CurateAMentionAPI(access_token,
    ...							 			  	  account_id,
    ...							 			  	  alert_id,
    ...							 			  	  mention_id,
    ...							 			  	  favorite,
    ...							 			  	  tone)

    >>> data = nandosMention.query()

    >>> data['favorite']				 			
    >>> 'true'

.. note::

     A mention can only be associated with an existing ``tag``. This means that you have to `create a tag<https://dev.mention.com/current/src/account/alert/tag/PostTag.html>`_ first. Mention-Python does not currently support this feature.


Mark all mentions read
----------------------

Mark all mentions as read for a given ``alert_id`` from an ``account_id``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nandos = mention.MarkAllMentionsReadAPI(access_token,
    ...							 			  	account_id,
    ...							 			  	alert_id)

    >>> data = nandos.query()
